This project has a complicated license since the root source of data and
contributions could not be tracked down entirely. The dictionary entries
themselves are in public domain, but the tag placements were at least in part
derived from tags in Gutenberg Ebook#673, which (the tags) were copyrighted
(see notice below). Therefore all contributions I made are also released with
the same license, since they were made possible thanks to those tags.

-------------------------------

The field marks "<...>" in this version are copyrighted,
the actual dictionary entries are in the Public Domain,
and we hope to re-publish these files in Plain Vanilla ASCII
You are welcome to strip all the markup information to help us
create such a version, or to create one on your own.

LICENSE
You can (and are encouraged!) to copy and distribute this

your right to copy and distribute it is limited by the copyright
laws and by the conditions of this "Small Print!" statement.

  [A]  ALL COPIES: The Project permits you to distribute
copies of this etext electronically or on any machine readable
medium now known or hereafter discovered so long as you:

     (1)  Honor the refund and replacement provisions of this
"Small Print!" statement; and

profits you derive calculated using the method you already use

profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are payable to "Project
Gutenberg Association / Illinois Benedictine College" within
the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were legally
required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax
return.

  [B]  EXACT AND MODIFIED COPIES: The copies you distribute
must either be exact copies of this etext, including this
Small Print statement, or can be in binary, compressed, mark-
up, or proprietary form (including any form resulting from
word processing or hypertext software), so long as *EITHER*:

     (1)  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
does *not* contain characters other than those intended by the
author of the work, although tilde (~), asterisk (*) and
underline (_) characters may be used to convey punctuation
intended by the author, and additional characters may be used
to indicate hypertext links; OR

     (2)  The etext is readily convertible by the reader at no
expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent form by the
program that displays the etext (as is the case, for instance,
with most word processors); OR

     (3)  You provide or agree to provide on request at no
additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the etext in plain
ASCII.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES

described below, the Project (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext)
disclaims all liability to you for damages, costs and
expenses, including legal fees, and YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

consequential damages, so the above disclaimers and exclusions
may not apply to you, and you may have other legal rights.
