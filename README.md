## Notes

The source of this project is most likely to be a derived work of
[Gutenberg#673][] ([evidence][] in commit c27157a), although it does include
data which cannot be found in #673 (e.g. most pronunciations, "Newly added
words" etc.). Thus the original Gutenberg license/copyright applies (a copy
can be found [here](./LICENSE)).

Please consider supporting [Project Gutenberg][] so that they may continue to
